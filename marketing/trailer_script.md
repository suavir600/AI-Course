# Course Trailer Script (60–90s)

[Hook] What if you could build and ship real neural networks — from scratch to transformers — in weeks, not months?
[Problem] Most courses drown you in theory or copy‑paste code.
[Promise] Code what matters: scratch NN, PyTorch loop, CIFAR‑10 CNN, transformer classifier.
[Proof] Hands‑on notebooks, autograded assignments, clear rubrics, pro techniques.
[Path] Start with neurons/backprop → CNNs → Transformer fine‑tune. Project each module.
